# What is Annotate ME?
Annotate ME allows users to annotate texts/date in web browser.By this we are plannig to build a database with texts and their category which will be used by Dr.Ashish Anand to feed for his Machine Learning Algorithms.This is our first step towards it.Any user can simply select text in browser page and put an appropriate label to it and one can also visit website to see previously annotated texts. We are also planning to make this data openly available so that any one who needs this data for his research work can get it.

# Services Used:
We are aggreeing to all terms and conditions to use [Google Chrome API](https://developers.google.com/terms/) and [Apache server](https://www.apachefriends.org).

# Overview
## Technical Details
You'll find technical detail for Website, Chrome-extension and firefox-plugin in correspondence folder.

## Annotation
This is simple and being very useful in near future specially for research purpose.It allows user to select and store their annotated data in database on a global server from where user can get the data as required by him like texts annotated only by him,all data under specific category,etc.
