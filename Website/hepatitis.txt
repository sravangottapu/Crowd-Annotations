hepatitis

Hepatitis is a disease of the liver characterized by the presence of inflammatory cells in the tissue of the organ. Hepatitis may occur without symptoms, but can lead to jaundice (a yellow discoloration of the skin, mucous membranes, and conjunctiva of the eyes), poor appetite, and fatigue. Depending on the cause, hepatitis can manifest either as an acute or as a chronic disease.[1] Acute hepatitis can be self-limiting (resolving on its own), can progress to chronic hepatitis, or can cause acute liver failure in rare instances.[2] Chronic hepatitis may have no symptoms, or may progress over time to fibrosis (scarring of the liver) and cirrhosis (chronic liver failure).[3] Cirrhosis of the liver increases the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (a form of liver cancer).[4]\r\n\r\nWorldwide, viral hepatitis is the most common cause, followed closely by alcoholic liver disease and non-alcoholic liver disease (NAFLD).[5][6][7] Other less common causes of hepatitis include autoimmune diseases, ingestion of toxic substances, certain medications (such as paracetamol), some industrial organic solvents, and plants.\r\n\r\nThe plural is hepatitides. The word is derived from the Greek hêpar (ἧπαρ), meaning \"liver\", and the suffix -itis (-ῖτις), meaning \"inflammation\" (c. 1727).[8]
