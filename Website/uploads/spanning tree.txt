spanning tree

For any cut C of the graph, if the weight of an edge e in the cut-set of C is strictly smaller than the weights of all other edges of the cut-set of C, then this edge belongs to all MSTs of the graph.\r\n\r\nProof: assume the contrary, i.e., in the figure at right, make edge BC (weight 6) part of the MST T instead of edge e (weight 4). Adding e to T will produce a cycle, while replacing BC with e would produce MST of smaller weight. Thus, a tree containing BC is not a MST, a contradiction that violates our assumption. By a similar argument, if more than one edge is of minimum weight across a cut, then each such edge is contained in some minimum spanning tree.
