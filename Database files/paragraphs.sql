(1, 'An article (abbreviated art) is a word (or prefix or suffix) that is used with a noun to indicate the type of reference being made by the noun. Articles specify grammatical definiteness of the noun, in some languages extending to volume or numerical scope. The articles in the English language are the and a/an, and (in certain contexts) some. ''An'' and ''a'' are modern forms of the Old English ''an'', which in Ganglia dialects was the number ''one'' (compare ''on'', in Saxon dialects) and survived into Modern Scots as the number ''wan''. Both ''on'' (respelled ''one'' by the Normans) and ''an'' survived into Modern English, with ''one'' used as the number and ''an'' (''a'', before nouns that begin with a consonant sound) as an indefinite article.\r\n\r\nIn many languages, articles are a special part of speech, which cannot easily be combined with other parts of speech. In English, articles are frequently considered a part of a broader speech category called determiners, which combines articles and demonstratives (such as ''this'' and ''that'').\r\n\r\nIn languages that employ articles, every common noun, with some exceptions, is expressed with a certain definiteness (e.g., definite or indefinite), just as many languages express every noun with a certain grammatical number (e.g., singular or plural). Every noun must be accompanied by the article, if any, corresponding to its definiteness, and the lack of an article (considered a zero article) itself specifies a certain definiteness. This is in contrast to other adjectives and determiners, which are typically optional. This obligatory nature of articles makes them among the most common words in many languagesâ€”in English, for example, the most frequent word is the.[1]\r\n\r\nArticles are usually characterized as either definite or indefinite.[2] A few languages with well-developed systems of articles may distinguish additional subtypes. Within each type, languages may have various forms of each article, according to grammatical attributes such as gender, number, or case, or according to adjacent sounds.\r\n', 'kamal', 'article'),
(2, 'Definite article[edit]\r\nA definite article indicates that its noun is a particular one which is identifiable to the listener. It may be something that the speaker has already mentioned, or it may be something uniquely specified. The definite article in English, for both singular and plural nouns, is the.\r\n\r\nThe children know the fastest way home.\r\nThe sentence above refers to specific children and a specific way home; it contrasts with the much more general observation that:\r\n\r\nChildren know the fastest ways home.\r\nThe latter sentence refers to children in general and their specific ways home. Likewise,\r\n\r\nGive me the book.\r\nrefers to a specific book whose identity is known or obvious to the listener; as such it has a markedly different meaning from\r\n\r\nGive me a book.\r\nwhich uses an indefinite article, which does not specify what book is to be given.\r\n\r\nThe definite article can also be used in English to indicate a specific class among other classes:\r\n\r\nThe cabbage white butterfly lays its eggs on members of the Brassica genus.\r\nHowever, recent developments show that definite articles are morphological elements linked to certain noun types due to lexicalization. Under this point of view, definiteness does not play a role in the selection of a definite article more than the lexical entry attached to the article.[3][4]\r\n\r\nThe definite article is sometimes also used with proper names, which are already specified by definition (there is just one of them). For example: the Amazon, the Hebrides. In these cases, the definite article may be considered superfluous. Its presence can be accounted for by the assumption that they are shorthand for a longer phrase in which the name is a specifier, i.e. the Amazon River, the Hebridean Islands. Where the nouns in such longer phrases cannot be omitted, the definite article is universally kept: the United States, the People''s Republic of China. This distinction can sometimes become a political matter: the former usage the Ukraine stressed the word''s Russian meaning of "borderlands"; as Ukraine became a fully independent state following the collapse of the Soviet Union, it requested formal mentions of its name omit the article. Similar shifts in usage have occurred in the names of Sudan and both Congo (Brazzaville) and (Kinshasa); a move in the other direction occurred with The Gambia.\r\n\r\nSome languages also use definite articles with personal names. For example, such use is standard in Portuguese (a Maria, literally: "the Maria") and in Greek (Î· ÎœÎ±ÏÎ¯Î±, Î¿ Î“Î¹ÏŽÏÎ³Î¿Ï‚, Î¿ Î”Î¿ÏÎ½Î±Î²Î·Ï‚, Î· Î Î±ÏÎ±ÏƒÎºÎµÏ…Î®). It also occurs colloquially in Spanish, German, Italian and other languages. In Hungary it is considered to be a Germanism.\r\n\r\nRarely, this usage can appear in English. A prominent example is how U.S. businessperson Donald J. Trump is known as "The Donald", this wording being used by many publications such as Newsweek and New York Post. Another is U.S. President Ronald W. Reagan''s nickname as "The Gipper";[5] publisher Townhall.com issued an article after Reagan''s death titled simply "Goodbye to ''the Gipper''".[6]\r\n\r\nIndefinite article[edit]\r\nAn indefinite article indicates that its noun is not a particular one (or ones) identifiable to the listener. It may be something that the speaker is mentioning for the first time, or its precise identity may be irrelevant or hypothetical, or the speaker may be making a general statement about any such thing. English uses a/an, from the Old English forms of the number ''one'', as its primary indefinite article. The form an is used before words that begin with a vowel sound (even if spelled with an initial consonant, as in an hour), and a before words that begin with a consonant sound (even if spelled with a vowel, as in a European).\r\n\r\nShe had a house so large that an elephant would get lost without a map.\r\nBefore some words beginning with a pronounced (not silent) h in an unstressed first syllable, such as hallucination, hilarious, historic(al), horrendous, and horrific, some (especially older) British writers prefer to use an over a (an historical event, etc.).[7] An is also preferred before hotel by some writers of British English (probably reflecting the relatively recent adoption of the word from French, where the h is not pronounced).[8] The use of "an" before words beginning with an unstressed "h" is more common generally in British English than American.[8] American writers normally use a in all these cases, although there are occasional uses of an historic(al) in American English.[9] According to the New Oxford Dictionary of English, such use is increasingly rare in British English too.[7] Unlike British English, American English typically uses an before herb, since the h in this word is silent for most Americans. The correct usage in respect of the term "hereditary peer" was the subject of an amendment debated in the UK Parliament.[10]\r\n\r\nUsing a before a word beginning with a vowel sound in unstressed syllables - such as I left a orange on the working surface - is is not uncommon, but is universally considered non-standard.\r\n\r\nThe word some is used as a functional plural of a/an.[citation needed] "An apple" never means more than one apple. "Give me some apples" indicates more than one is desired but without specifying a quantity. This finds comparison in Spanish, where the singular indefinite article ''un/una'' ("one") is completely indistinguishable from the unit number, except where it has a plural form (''unos/unas''): Dame una manzana" ("Give me an apple") > "Dame unas manzanas" ("Give me some apples"). However, some also serves as a quantifier rather than as a plural article, as in "There are some apples there, but not many."\r\n\r\nSome also serves as a singular indefinite article, as in "There is some person on the porch". This usage differs from the usage of a(n) in that some indicates that the identity of the noun is unknown to both the listener and the speaker, while a(n) indicates that the identity is unknown to the listener without specifying whether or not it is known to the speaker.[citation needed] Thus There is some person on the porch indicates indefiniteness to both the listener and the speaker, while There is a person on the porch indicates indefiniteness to the listener but gives no information as to whether the speaker knows the person''s identity.\r\n\r\nPartitive article[edit]\r\nA partitive article is a type of indefinite article used with a mass noun such as water, to indicate a non-specific quantity of it. Partitive articles are used in French and Italian in addition to definite and indefinite articles. (In Finnish and Estonian, the partitive is indicated by inflection.) The nearest equivalent in English is some, although this is considered a determiner and not an article.\r\n\r\nFrench: Veux-tu du cafÃ© ?\r\nDo you want (some) coffee? (or, dialectally but more accurately, Do you want some of this coffee?)\r\nSee also more information about the French partitive article.\r\nHaida has a partitive article (suffixed -gyaa) referring to "part of something or... to one or more objects of a given group or category," e.g., tluugyaa uu hal tlaahlaang ''he is making a boat (a member of the category of boats).''[11]\r\n\r\nNegative article[edit]\r\nA negative article specifies none of its noun, and can thus be regarded as neither definite nor indefinite. On the other hand, some consider such a word to be a simple determiner rather than an article. In English, this function is fulfilled by no, which can appear before a singular or plural noun:\r\n\r\nNo man has been on this island.\r\nNo dogs are allowed here.\r\nNo one is in the room.\r\nZero article[edit]\r\nSee also: Zero article in English\r\nThe zero article is the absence of an article. In languages having a definite article, the lack of an article specifically indicates that the noun is indefinite. Linguists interested in X-bar theory causally link zero articles to nouns lacking a determiner.[12] In English, the zero article rather than the indefinite is used with plurals and mass nouns, although the word "some" can be used as an indefinite plural article.\r\n\r\nVisitors end up walking in mud.\r\nVariation among languages[edit]\r\n\r\nArticles in languages in and around Europe\r\n  indefinite and definite articles\r\n  only definite articles\r\n  indefinite and suffixed definite articles\r\n  only suffixed definite articles\r\n  no articles\r\nNote that although the Saami languages spoken in northern parts of Norway and Sweden lack articles, Norwegian and Swedish are the majority languages in this area. Note also that although the Irish and Scottish Gaelic languages lack indefinite articles they too are minority languages in this area, with English being the main spoken language.\r\nArticles are found in many Indo-European, Semitic, and Polynesian languages but formally are absent from some large languages of the world, such as Indonesian, Japanese, Hindi and Russian.\r\n\r\nLinguists believe the common ancestor of the Indo-European languages, Proto-Indo-European, did not have articles. Most of the languages in this family do not have definite or indefinite articles; there is no article in Latin, Sanskrit, nor in some modern Indo-European languages, such as the families of Slavic languages (not including Bulgarian, Macedonian and Torlakian, which are rather distinctive among the Slavic languages in terms of grammar) and Baltic languages. Although Classical Greek has a definite article (which has survived into Modern Greek and which bears strong resemblance to the German definite article), the earlier Homeric Greek used this article largely as a pronoun or demonstrative. Articles developed independently in several language families.\r\n\r\nNot all languages have both definite and indefinite articles, and some languages have different types of definite and indefinite articles to distinguish finer shades of meaning; for example, French and Italian have a partitive article used for indefinite mass nouns, whereas Colognian has two distinct sets of definite articles indicating focus and uniqueness, and Macedonian uses definite articles in a demonstrative sense, with a tripartite distinction (proximal, medial, distal) based on distance from the speaker or interlocutor. The words this and that (and their plurals, these and those) can be understood in English as, ultimately, forms of the definite article the (whose declension in Old English included thaes, an ancestral form of this/that and these/those).\r\n\r\nIn many languages, the form of the article may vary according to the gender, number, or case of its noun. In some languages the article may be the only indication of the case. Many languages do not use articles at all, and may use other ways of indicating old versus new information, such as topicâ€“comment constructions.\r\n', 'kamal', 'more news on the topic'),
(3, 'A general-purpose computer has these parts:\r\nprocessor: the ``brain'''' that does arithmetic, responds to incoming information, and generates outgoing information\r\nprimary storage (memory or RAM): the ``scratchpad'''' that remembers information that can be used by the processor. It is connected to the processor by a system bus (wiring).\r\nsystem and expansion busses: the transfer mechanisms (wiring plus connectors) that connect the processor to primary storage and input/output devices.\r\nA computer usually comes with several input/output devices: For input: a keyboard, a mouse; For output, a display (monitor), a printer; For both input and output: an internal disk drive, memory key, CD reader/writer, etc., as well as connections to external networks.\r\nFor reasons of speed, primary storage is connected ``more closely'''' to the processor than are the input/output devices. Most of the devices (e.g., internal disk, printer) are themselves primitive computers in the sense that they contain simple processors that help transfer information to/from the processor to/from the device.\r\n\r\nHere is a simple picture that summarizes the above:\r\n', 'kamal', 'computer'),
(4, 'Information and binary coding\r\n\r\nFor humans, information can be pictures, symbols, words, sounds, movements, and more. A typical computer has a keyboard and mouse so that words and movements can be sent to the processor as information. The information must be converted into electrical off-on (``0 and 1'''') pulses that travel on the bus and arrive to the processor, which can save them in primary storage.\r\nIt is premature to study precisely how numbers and symbols can be represented as off-on (0-1) pulses, but here is review of base-2 (binary) coding of numbers, which is the concept upon which computer information is based:\r\n', 'kamal', 'information'),
(5, 'The data registers hold numbers for computation, as noted earlier.\r\nThere is a simple clock --- a pulse generator --- that helps the Control Unit do instructions in proper time steps.\r\nThe arithmetic-logic unit (ALU) holds the wiring for doing arithmetic on the numbers held in the data registers. (Review the addition example above.)\r\nThe control unit holds wiring that triggers the arithmetic operations in the ALU. How does the control unit know to request an addition or a subtraction? The answer is: it obtains instructions, one at a time, that have been stored in primary storage.\r\nThe instruction counter is a register that tells the control unit where to find the instruction that it must do. (The details will be explained shortly.)\r\nThe instruction register is where the instruction can be copied and held for study by the control unit,\r\nThe address buffer and data buffer are two registers that are a ``drop-off'''' point when the processor wishes to copy information from a register to primary storage (or read information from primary storage to a register). We study them later.\r\nThe interrupt register is studied much later.\r\n', 'kamal', 'points'),

(7, 'Anthrax is a disease with rapid onset caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Most forms of the disease are lethal, and it affects most animals. It can be transmitted through contact with infected meat. Effective vaccines against anthrax are available, and some forms of the disease respond well to antibiotic treatment. Anthrax can occur in three forms: skin, inhalation, and intestinal.[1]\r\n\r\nLike many other members of the genus Bacillus, B. anthracis can form dormant spores that are able to survive in harsh conditions for decades or even centuries.[2] Such spores can be found on all continents, including Antarctica.[3] When inhaled, eaten, or come into contact with an area of broken skin, they may become reactivated and multiply rapidly.\r\n\r\nUsually infection develops in plant eating mammals that eat or breathe in the spores while grazing. Eating is thought to be the most common route by which herbivores contract anthrax. Carnivores living in the same environment may become infected by eating infected animals. Diseased animals can spread anthrax to humans, either through direct contact or by eating raw or undercooked meat from infected animals. B. anthracis bacterial spores are soil-borne. Disturbed grave sites of infected animals have been known to cause infection over 70 years after the animal''s death.[4]\r\n\r\nUntil the 20th century, anthrax infections killed hundreds of thousands of people and other animals each year.[5] The disease is more common in countries without good public health programs and it continues to be a problem in less developed countries. French scientist Louis Pasteur developed the first effective vaccine in 1881.[6][7][8] Anthrax has been developed as a weapon in the past by at least five state bioweapons programsâ€”those of the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States, Russia, and Iraqâ€”and has been attempted by several others.[9]\r\n', 'ashish_anand', 'anthrax'),
(8, 'All animals have eukaryotic cells, surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins.[15] This may be calcified to form structures like shells, bones, and spicules.[16] During development, it forms a relatively flexible framework[17] upon which cells can move about and be reorganized, making complex structures possible. In contrast, other multicellular organisms, like plants and fungi, have cells held in place by cell walls, and so develop by progressive growth.[13] Also, unique to animal cells are the following intercellular junctions: tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes.[18]\r\n', 'ashish_anand', 'sravan'),
(9, 'All animals are heterotrophs, meaning that they feed directly or indirectly on other living things.[31] They are often further subdivided into groups such as carnivores, herbivores, omnivores, and parasites.[32]\r\n\r\nPredation is a biological interaction where a predator (a heterotroph that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked).[33] Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation almost always results in the death of the prey.[34] The other main category of consumption is detritivory, the consumption of dead organic matter.[35] It can at times be difficult to separate the two feeding behaviours, for example, where parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on its decaying corpse. Selective pressures imposed on one another has led to an evolutionary arms race between prey and predator, resulting in various antipredator adaptations.[36]\r\n\r\nMost animals indirectly use the energy of sunlight by eating plants or plant-eating animals. Most plants use light to convert inorganic molecules in their environment into carbohydrates, fats, proteins and other biomolecules, characteristically containing reduced carbon in the form of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Starting with carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), photosynthesis converts the energy of sunlight into chemical energy in the form of simple sugars (e.g., glucose), with the release of molecular oxygen. These sugars are then used as the building blocks for plant growth, including the production of other biomolecules.[13] When an animal eats plants (or eats other animals which have eaten plants), the reduced carbon compounds in the food become a source of energy and building materials for the animal.[37] They are either used directly to help the animal grow, or broken down, releasing stored solar energy, and giving the animal the energy required for motion.[38][39]\r\n\r\nAnimals living close to hydrothermal vents and cold seeps on the ocean floor are not dependent on the energy of sunlight.[40] Instead chemosynthetic archaea and bacteria form the base of the food chain.[41]\r\n', 'ashish_anand', 'food');
